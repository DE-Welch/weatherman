# Project Summary

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevMountain/weatherman/master/readme-assets/solution.PNG"/>

In this project we'll be building a weather app that allows users to search for the current weather anywhere in the world. We'll make use of the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API and [Redux Promise Middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware) to accomplish this in a user friendly fashion.

## Setup

* Go to <a href="https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up">OpenWeatherMap</a> and create an account. You'll need an API key to complete this project. 
  * The API key can take up to 10 minutes to activate.
* `Fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm start` to spin up the development server.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we will create a file that contains and exports our API Key from `OpenWeatherMap`.  The app won't actually run until you've done this step.

### Instructions

* Create a new file in `src` named `apiKey.js`.
* In `src/apiKey.js` export default your API Key in a string.
  * You can locate your API Key <a href="https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys">here</a> after you've signed up and logged in.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> src/apiKey.js </code> </summary>

```js
export default "API_KEY_HERE";
```

</details>

## Step 4

### Summary
Now it's time to get started actually running automation.

### Instructions
* Create `nightwatch.conf.js` and `nightwatchProps.js` to configure Nightwatch.
* Feel free to copy them from another repo!
* Set up your testing skeleton/framework
* Gather selectors and test data
* Convert your tests in JIRA into automated tests!

<details>

<summary> Detailed Instruction </summary>

<br />

* Create the `nightwatch` folder in the base directory of your repository.
* Inside `nightwatch` create two folders, one `tests`, and another `test_data`.

|_nightwatch
  |_tests
  |\_test_data

* In your `test_data` folder you can create files for your test data, selectors and helper functions.  You'll create files for your tests in the `tests` folder.

Remember in each of your files for test data to export the info:

```js
module.exports = {

}
```

And to require the info in your tests:

```js
const selectors = require('../test_data/selectors')
```

Otherwise, have at it!  Ask if you have questions.
